5-year renewal of the central bank's payment of business permits to 27 non-banking institutions, such as Alipay
In order to integrate the business resources, exert the scale effect and improve the efficiency of supervision, this renewal is to adjust its business scope accordingly to the payment institution which intends to merge the payment business license.
The merged payment agency shall complete the payment business within 6 months from the date of the announcement.
The People's Bank of China will handle the cancellation and renewal of the relevant "Payment business license" after the completion of the business undertaking.
This renewal is to reduce the scope of business due to serious breaches of business, stagnation in business, or termination of business by the voluntary application.
Relevant agencies shall, within 6 months from the date of announcement, suspend the relevant payment business as required.
The People's Bank of China will continue to carry out the "Payment business license" in accordance with law and prudence.
