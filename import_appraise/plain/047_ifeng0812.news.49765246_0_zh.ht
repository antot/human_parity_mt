Recently, the Cixiao Foundation of Hebei Province has delivered consolation money of 16,000 RMB to 6 families at the villages of Xiaozuo, Taitou, and Guiquan in Jingjing County who had lost a loved one.
This is yet another consolation and care campaign initiated by the Fund after their previous search for “Lost Youths, Children, and Elderly Victims of the July 19 Flood”.
Heavy rain on July 19 affected multiple areas in Hebei Province, leading to floods to parts of the province with people going missing and dying as a result.
The good man “Old Iron” lost his life when volunteering for a drainage project for his community, leaving behind a 2-year old son and a pregnant wife. The story of good “Old Iron” quickly moved the entire provincial town.
On August 4, work personnel from the Hebei Province Cixiao Fund and volunteers of the Hebei brand association arrived at good “Old Iron’s” home to deliver a charity fund of 3,200 RMB to his surviving family members.
When Ye Li, vice director of the brand association, learned about the conditions faced by the family members of “Old Iron”, she decided to initiate a “Charity Sales” event amongst corporate members in the brand association to help the “Old Iron's” family members make it through the tough times.
The Hebei Province Cixiao Fund, also known by its full name as the Hebei Province Volunteer Service Foundation - Cixiao Fund, was founded in August 2015 by the organizing committee of Hebei Brand Association.
