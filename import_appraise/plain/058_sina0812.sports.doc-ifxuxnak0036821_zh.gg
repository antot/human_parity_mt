James has signed two consecutive $number contracts since the summer of 2014 when he decided to return to the Cavaliers.
As the NBA's current labor agreement is about to enter its final year, James will be at the forefront of negotiations on labor agreements as Vice president of the NBA player's union.
Thanks to a big boost in the union's revenues, it's a tribute to the new television deal and the battle between bosses and players about how to deal with the money, fearing that the NBA will fall into a standstill next summer.
But for James, he doesn't have to worry about becoming a free agent next summer because he's already signed a 3-year contract with the Cavaliers.
No matter when the 2017-18 season starts officially, James is in the contract.
