Uber has operated in Taiwan for 4 years, significantly impacting the traditional taxi industry in the region.
Taiwan’s United Daily News reported on August 12 that on the morning of the 12th, more than 100 taxis circled Taiwan's “Executive Yuan” as drivers staged a protest, severely paralyzing traffic in the surrounding area.
Taipei City Professional Drivers' Union President Cheng Li-chia said however that Uber has been in Taiwan for four years, but the Taiwanese authorities will only convene a meeting at the end of the month. Taxi drivers refuse to wait any longer.
However, the government failed to keep its promise, and delayed time and again.
Law-abiding taxi drivers are considered lower class workers, but they feel deceived by the government now that they have to compete with illegal and unrestricted Uber drivers.
