In the same year, at about 10: 00 on October 5, the defendant was again caught by the public security police when he came to a hotel room in Wolong District, Nanyang City, using a pseudo-base station to send a group of fraudulent text messages.
The pseudo-base station device was assessed to have sent 622,228 text messages on October 4, 2015, causing 62,228 mobile phone users to have their communications interrupted for more than eight seconds to less than 10 minutes per person.
The court heard that the defendant, Li Huiwang, had used a fake base station to send a total of 62,228 fraudulent text messages to an unspecified majority, and that his actions had constituted a crime of fraud.
As for the defense's suggestion that the defendant committed an attempted crime when he was caught and did not cause any consequences, he has a better attitude of confessing his crime, and it is suggested that his suggestion of a lighter punishment should be adopted.
The defendant was sentenced to four years and six months' imprisonment and a fine of $10,000 for the crime of fraud, taking into account the nature of the crime and his attitude toward the admission of guilt.
