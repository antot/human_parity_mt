Gillied gets a lawyer's fee in the fight against Merck's hepatitis C patent
According to a U.S. District Judge, the company has the right to receive a lawyer's fee in a patent lawsuit against hepatitis C, a pharmaceutical company in the United States Merck Group.
In June, after US judges found wrongdoing in Merck, including perjury and other unethical practices, he was exempt from paying $200 million in compensation for Bouvet and Havoni, which violated Merck's two patents.
In a lawsuit in Thursday, U.S. District Judge 贝斯·兰博松·弗里曼 said that Geely did not have to bear the costs incurred by the defence.
Merck is trying to catch up with the new market for hepatitis C drugs. Jim's drugs can cure more than 90% of patients with hepatitis.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gillied and Merck sued each other, claiming that they were an active ingredient in the Geely drug, the owner of Bouvet's laboratory work.
