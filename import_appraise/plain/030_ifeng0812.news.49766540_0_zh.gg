As of June this year, the net inflow of migrants in New Zealand in 12 months was 69,100, becoming the main driver of New Zealand's population growth in recent years.
In addition, in the same time period, the population of New Zealand natural growth of 28,200 people.
Data show that in the last 10 years, New Zealand average annual net inflow of 21,800 people, the average annual population growth of 32,300 people.
From a demographic perspective, a large influx of immigrants means that the proportion of the "working-age population" from 15 to 39 is gradually widening.
In the 12-month period ending June 2016, the New Zealand working-age population grew by 3.6% to 1.58 million people.
At the same time, the 65-year-old population increases by 3.6%, reaching 700,000 people.
