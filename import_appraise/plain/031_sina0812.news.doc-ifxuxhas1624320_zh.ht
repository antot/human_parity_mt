Han, a 63-year old homeless individual, began arguing with Xiao, another homeless individual, and then drew a blade to stab the latter to death.
Han said that prior to the incident, he and the homeless person Xiao lived at the same alley in Dongcheng District. They were only 20 meters from each other.
Han said that during the day of the incident, both of them were invited by a friend for a drink. The two argued twice during the meal and after the meal.
Han said he was afraid that Xiao might hit him, so he picked up a paring knife and stabbed him to death.
During the court proceedings, the grieving family members demanded Han to pay a compensation amounting to over 530,000 RMB for the burial fees and death of the victim.
