The Siberian tiger is now listed as an endangered (EN) species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List.
According to the Forestry Department of Jilin, the 1998 data from a joint monitoring exercise by China, the US and Russia showed that there were only four to six Siberian tigers, and three to five Amur leopards living in the wild in Jilin Province.
According to Yu Changchun, director of the conservation section of the Jilin Forestry Department, said that Jilin Province has been expanding protection efforts for the wildlife. The populations of the northeastern tiger and northeastern leopard have achieved significant growth and their ranges have been growing as well.
Data from the latest monitoring in 2015 revealed that 27 Siberian tigers and 42 Amur leopards living in the wild were detected within Jilin Province.
As flagship species of World Animal Protection distributed across the China-Russia border, the China-Russia partnership is especially meaningful to restore and increase the populations of northeastern tigers and leopards.
According to the Department of Forestry of Jilin, the province has established a long-term and stable system of cooperation and exchange.
During the 2016 International Conference for the Conservation of Hunchun Tigers and Leopards of China that concluded on the 11th, forestry agencies and animal protection groups of China and Russia have once again reached multiple consensus.
The Jilin Forestry Department expressed that strengthening the conversation partnership between China and Russia is a desperate task for protecting the northeastern tigers and leopards of China. It is also imperative in maintaining the health of Russian tiger and leopard populations.
