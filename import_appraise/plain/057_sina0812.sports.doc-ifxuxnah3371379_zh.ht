Pogba received two yellow cards in the Coppa Italia, and was therefore barred from one game according to the regulations.
Although he has returned to the English Premier League, the Football Association has enforced the accumulated bans and extended it to the League games.
As a result, at the away match at Bournemouth on August 14, Pogba will watch from the stands. His return debut to Manchester United will be delayed to the 20th when the club plays Southampton at home.
