The ionosphere is filled with free electrons on some nights, which implies that radio signals can travel further.
According to a August 11 online report published by Popular Science, an American monthly journal, the US Air Force is interested in duplicating this effect.
Although an ionosphere and its vast reserve of free electrons can help people receive the radio broadcast from a certain university base station, this was probably not the interest of the US Air Force.
An ionosphere filled with electrons will provide military radios with a larger range of delivery and offer a certain degree of protection against the influence of solar storms for global positioning system (GPS) signals.
The final objective is to create a series of three-dimensional satellites as required. These would be able to enhance the ionosphere when required.
But first, the teams that have signed a contract with the Air Force must prove that the relevant scientific principles actually work.
