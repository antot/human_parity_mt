The country's inflation rate in the first seven months of this year was 3.7 percent, Tajikistan's Avesta news agency said on Monday, citing the central bank.
The country's inflation rate was 3.7 percent in the first seven months of the year, with an inflation rate of 0.6 percent in July, compared with 6 percent in the past year, the report said.
The government aims to keep annual inflation at 7.5 percent in 2016, compared with 5.1 percent in 2015, the report said.
Also, the report points out that there are some discrepancies between the forecasts of the government and some of the major international financial institutions when it comes to economic development and inflation in the country in 2016.
The country's economy will grow by 7 per cent in 2016, according to forecasts from the country's Ministry of Trade and Economic Development, while the country's inflation is also largely above that level.
The Asian Development Bank, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have given different forecasts for the country's economic development and inflation in 2016.
For both indicators, the projections are 4.2 per cent and 7 per cent for the Asian Development Bank, 4.8 per cent and 7.5 per cent for the World Bank and 3.4 per cent and 8.2 per cent for the International Monetary Fund.
Despite a series of adverse external factors, including the international economic downturn, the depreciation of the Russian rouble and the decline in remittances, the country's economy grew by 6% in 2015.
