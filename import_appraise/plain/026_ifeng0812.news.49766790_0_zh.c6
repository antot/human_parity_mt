On some nights, the ionosphere is filled with free electrons, which means that radio signals can go much further.
The U.S. Air Force is interested in replicating the effect, according to the August 11 report on the website of the popular science magazine.
While an ionosphere with a steady stream of free electrons could help people listen to a university radio station on the edge of its range, this may not be the Air Force's interest.
The electron-filled ionosphere means that the radio used by the military has a greater range, and it may provide some protection against solar storms for Global Positioning System (GPS) signals.
The ultimate goal may be to create a series of cube satellites, based on demand, that can strengthen the ionosphere when needed.
But first, these teams that contract with the Air Force must prove that the scientific principles will work.
