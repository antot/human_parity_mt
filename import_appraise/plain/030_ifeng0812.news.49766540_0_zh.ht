The New Zealand statistics department expressed that the only time when the population of New Zealand experienced a birth rate exceeding 2% was during 1974 and during the “baby boomer” period from 1950s to early 1960s.
As of June this year, New Zealand’s net inflow of migrants totaled 69,100 persons over a 12-month period, and has become a major driver of population growth for the nation in recent years.
During the same period, the population of New Zealand experienced a natural growth of 28,200 individuals.
Figures indicate that in the last decade, New Zealand’s average annual net migration flow was 21,800 persons, and the average annual organic population growth was 32,300 persons.
In terms of demographics, an influx of immigrants suggests that the proportion of “working-age population”, those between 15 and 39 years old, is expanding gradually.
For a period of 12 months up till June 2016, the working age population of New Zealand grew by 3.6% to reach a total of 1.58 million people.
At the same time, the population of senior citizens 65 years and older grew similarly by 3.6% to 700,000 people.
