James has signed two consecutive 1 + 1 contracts since deciding to return to the Cavaliers in the summer of 2014.
As the NBA's current collective bargaining agreement enters its final year, James will be at the forefront of collective bargaining as vice president of the NBA Players' Union.
Thanks to a new television deal and a battle between owners and players over what to do with the money, there are fears that the NBA will grind to a halt next summer, given the league's huge revenue boost.
But for James, he won't have to worry about becoming a free agent next summer because he has signed a three-year contract extension with the Cavaliers.
No matter when the 2017-18 season officially begins, James is under contract.
