Since having decided to return to the Cavaliers in the summer of 2014, James has signed two consecutive 1+1 contracts.
With the NBA labor agreement entering its final year, James, the First Vice President of the National Basketball Players Association, will find himself at the forefront of the labor agreement negotiation.
NBA revenues rose sharply thanks to the new TV broadcast agreement, and the battle between owners and players over the application of the proceeds. Outsiders were afraid that the NBA would experience a lockout next summer.
To James, he no longer has to worry about becoming a free agent for next Summer because he has signed a 3-year contract with the Cavaliers.
Regardless of when the 2017-18 season will officially begin, James will be under contract.
