The Siberian tiger, currently listed as an endangered (EN) species on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species.
According to the Forestry Department of Jilin Province, data from joint monitoring by China, the United States, Russia and other countries in 1998 showed that there were only four to six wild Siberian tigers and three to five northeastern leopards in Jilin Province.
According to Yu Changchun, director of the protection division of the Jilin Provincial Forestry Department, the population of Siberian tigers and northeastern leopards in China is growing significantly and the distribution area is expanding in recent years as Jilin Province has continuously increased its protection of wild animals.
The latest monitoring data for 2015 showed that 27 wild Siberian tigers and 42 northeastern leopards were detected in Jilin Province alone.
As the world's flagship wildlife conservation species distributed in the Sino-Russian border region, the cooperation between China and Russia is of great significance for the population restoration and reproduction of wild Siberian tigers and leopards.
Jilin Province has previously established a long-term and stable cooperation and exchange mechanism with Russia, according to the forestry department of Jilin Province.
At the 2016 Hunchun Tiger and Leopard Conservation International Forum in China, which ended on November 11, the forestry departments and animal protection organizations of China and Russia once again reached a number of common understandings.
Jilin Provincial Forestry Department said that strengthening cooperation between China and Russia in tiger and leopard conservation is not only a very urgent task facing China's northeast tiger and leopard conservation, but also to maintain the health of the Russian tiger and leopard population.
