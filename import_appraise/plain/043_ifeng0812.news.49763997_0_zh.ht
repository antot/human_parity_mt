According to news from Xinhuanet, the New South Wales state government of Australia will be spending 200 million Australian Dollars (approximately equivalent to 154 million USD) for the largest renovation project for the Sydney Opera House since the construction of the building.
The restoration will not change the shell shape of the theater, said the NSW government.
The Sydney Opera House designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon was completed in 1973, receiving around 8 million visitors  annually as a urban landmark.
​Sydney Symphony Orchestra Managing Director Rory Jeffes believed that the Sydney Opera House would use this renovation to “turnaround” and become “a concert hall with the greatest acoustics in the world.”
