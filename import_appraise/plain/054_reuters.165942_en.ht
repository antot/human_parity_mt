Gilead wins attorney fees in its hepatitis C patent battle against Merck
A US District Court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to receive legal fees it incurred in the hepatitis C patent litigation with pharmaceutical company Merck &amp; Co Inc.
In June, after discovering illegal activities committed by Merck, including false testimony and other unethical behaviors, the American judge ruled that Gilead is exempt from a 200 million USD compensation claim by Merck who charged that Gilead has infringed its two patents through sales of its popular drug sofosbuvir and harvoni.
During court proceedings on Thursday, US District Judge Beth Labson Freeman expressed that Gilead is not required to pay for expenses it incurred to defend its claims.
Merck is attempting to catch up with Gilead which has dominated the new generation hepatitis C pharmaceutical market. Gilead’s drug can treat more than 90% of hepatitis patients.
The case could be traced back to 2013 at the earliest when both Gilead and Merck charged each other. Both claimed themselves to be the owner of the lab work for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead’s pharmaceutical product.
