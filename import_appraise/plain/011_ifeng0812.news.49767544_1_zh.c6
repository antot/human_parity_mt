The Mayor of Rivas, Wilfredo LÃ³pez, said at the teacher training site that the Nicaraguan government agencies were working together with the HKND Group to promote environmental management plans and tree planting activities.
The HKND Group, as the developer of the canal project, has always followed international best practices and built the canal in accordance with international standards in order to maximize the protection of Nicaragua's ecological environment. "
Through a combination of theory and practice, university students lead primary and secondary school students to plant trees together to educate the next generation of Nicaraguan how to green the environment.
Francisco Reyes, a professor in the Department of Natural Resources and the Environment at the National Agricultural University of Nicaragua, led the team throughout the project.
"We have reason to believe that the Grand Canal project, also led by the HCND Group, will bring more benefits to the Nicaraguan people and create more jobs there," he said.
In order to ensure the long-term effects of afforestation, the HKND Group has also produced a training booklet on afforestation, which has been distributed to all 15,000 primary and secondary school students in Rivas province, with the aim of providing long-term technical guidance to teachers, students and parents.
