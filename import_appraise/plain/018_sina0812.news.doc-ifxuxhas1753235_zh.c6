Originally titled: 2000 chickens from a farm in Jiangsu were seized by the court and sold without permission
After the judgment came into effect, because Li did not automatically fulfill the obligations determined in the judgment, Wang applied to Shuyang court for enforcement.
On 16 October 2014, the Shuyang Court issued a civil ruling ordering the seizure of 2,000 laying hens from all of Li's farms and that they should not be transferred or sold without permission.
After receiving the seizure ruling, Li sold part of the hens seized in the farm without the permission of the Shuyang court.
By the time the Yuanyang County Public Security Bureau surveyed on March 8, 2015, there were only 142 eggs left in the farm.
