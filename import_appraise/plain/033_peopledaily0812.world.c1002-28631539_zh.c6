On April 27, 2015, the United States and Japan jointly released a new edition of the U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation Guidelines in New York, allowing Japan's armed forces to play a more offensive role around the world.
US Defense Secretary Ash Carter, US Secretary of State John Kerry, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and Japanese Defense Minister Nakatani attended a press conference in New York on the same day.
This is the fifth time that a Chinese nongovernmental think tank has published an assessment of Japan's military strength, and the fourth time it has launched an English version.
The report is divided into nine chapters, including general policy adjustment, military strength, national defense budget, military deployment, weapons and equipment, institutional reform, military training and exercises, foreign military security cooperation, and military security relations with China.
According to the report, 2015 marked the end of a period in which the Abe administration pushed through several years of major policy adjustments in the security sector.
Since then, Japan's initiatives in the area of security will be mainly at the operational level of the application of the rule of law, the implementation of strategies and the implementation of policies, rather than major adjustments and changes in frameworks, mechanisms and policies.
The report stressed that Abe ’ s cabinet is trying to achieve the multiple goals of promoting Japan ’ s “normal nationalization, ” stepping out of the Self-Defense Forces to intervene in international security affairs, strengthening the Japan-US alliance, and preventing China from dominating China through the three breakthroughs mentioned above.
Previously, the China Council for the Promotion of Strategic Culture issued Japan's military assessment reports on June 5, 2012, July 19, 2013, July 23, 2014, and June 30, 2015, respectively.
