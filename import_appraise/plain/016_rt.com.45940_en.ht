Jewish filmmaker criticizes Berlin hotel for removing Israel’s dial code upon “request” by an Arab guest - Reuters
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin told the media that the Kempinski Hotel in Berlin did not list Israel’s dial code, and a hotel employee said that this was in accordance with a “request” made by an Arab customer. This triggered a public outcry.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of Shoah, a documentary film about the Jewish Holocaust, expressed his disappointment in Kempinski hotel and wrote an open letter that was posted on the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
When he last checked-in, Lanzmann wanted to find Israel in the list of telephone dialing codes provided by the hotel.
But Israel is not in the country list available for in-room direct dialing
How did Israel disappeared from the 2016 German capital of Berlin?
Lanzmann wrote.
In replacement, guests can now use the Kempinski Hotel call center to make a call to Israel.
To search for an explanation, this film producer asked the hotel receptionist.
Lanzmann wrote in the letter that the answer he got at the front desk was " shocking".
Hotel staff expressed that “this was a deliberate decision made by the management of Kempinski Hotel”.
The reason for doing that was to infuriate the filmmaker.
Lanzmann quoted what this employee said, “The majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded Israel’s code to be deleted.”
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, the Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, treated this event as a “great shame”.
We were shocked when we found out about this.
This is a huge shame in itself.
The incident that occurred in Germany and the franchise hotel was shameless.
This matter does not require further explanations.
“We hope that this Hotel can provide an accurate conclusion,” the official expressed.
This matter triggered an intense debate on the Internet. Everyone thought it was scandalous.
Some people felt that the Kempinski Hotel “groveled” just to keep the Arab customer happy.
Another post said that the hotel is “shameless” and pointed out that the famous Kurfürstendamm that the establishment was located is next to a synagogue.
Der Spiegel reported that the hotel swiftly clarified all accusations. It claimed that it was all due to “negligence”, and “apologized” to Lanzmann.
Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a Kempinski representative as saying, “There was never a direct order to remove Israel from the fast dial list.”
This paper also claimed that the dial code of Israel has been added to the list.
