The Bureau of Statistics said New Zealand's population growth had previously been just over 2 per cent in 1974 and at the peak of the "baby boom" population in the 1950s and early 1960s.
New Zealand's net inflow of migrants in the 12 months to June was 691,000, making it the main driver of population growth in recent years.
Also, the natural increase in New Zealand's population over the same time period was 28.2 million.
The figures show that over the last 10 years, New Zealand has had an average annual net inflow of migrants of 2.18 million and an average annual natural population growth of 3.23 million.
Demographically, the influx of migrants has meant a gradual increase in the proportion of "working-age people" between the ages of 15 and 39.
New Zealand's working-age population grew 3.6 percent to 1.58 million in the 12 months to June 2016.
At the same time, the increase in the elderly population over the age of 65 was also 3.6 percent, reaching 7 million people.
