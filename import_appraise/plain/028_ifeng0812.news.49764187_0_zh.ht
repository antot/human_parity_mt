Non-residents of Beijing who have lived in Beijing for more than six months, and comply with the one of the conditions of having legal and stable employment, legal and stable residence or continuous study, may apply for a residence permit.
Recently, Beijing issued detailed rules for the implementation of the Interim Rules on Residence Permit. This implies that the “temporary residence permit” will be upgraded to “residence permit”.
Head officials of relevant departments said that the transformation of “temporary residence permit” to “residence permit” meant that the City of Beijing will move away from “managing” long-term residents from outside the city and instead provide them with a wide selection of services.
