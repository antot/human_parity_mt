Non-Beijing citizens who have lived in Beijing for more than six months and who meet one of the requirements for lawful and stable employment, legal stable residence and continuous study in Beijing may apply for a residence permit.
Recently, Beijing "Temporary Residence Permit Regulations" detailed implementation rules, which means that the "temporary residence permit" will be upgraded to "residence permit."
The shift from "temporary residence permits" to "residence permits" means Beijing will shift from "management" to multi-faceted services for the non-Beijing resident population, according to department heads.
