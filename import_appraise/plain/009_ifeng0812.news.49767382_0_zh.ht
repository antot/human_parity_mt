The police forces of Lingshui have joined in the investigation. Lingshui traffic departments will also strengthen measures to correct issues regarding illegally operating business vehicles.
“The outcome of a police investigation into the August 4 conflict is still pending. Just after midnight on August 11, the homes of another two taxi drivers were wrecked.”
“Trishaws operate illegally mostly during the night these days. We hope that the governing departments can also intensify their efforts to remedy the situation.”
A reporter of Hinews learned from the Lingshui Li Autonomous County Police Department that the police is currently handling two reports. Further investigations are being carried out for the motive and responsible individuals behind the two cases as well as the relationships between them.
Wang Wenyi, traffic management station master of Lingshui Transport Bureau, said that Lingshui Transport Department has set out to deal with trishaws that transport passengers illegally since the beginning of this year, and has outlawed a total of 613 illegal passenger trishaws.
In the next step, the transportation department will submit applications to the county government, working with multiple departments to step up enforcements to reorganize tricycles, motorcycles, unlicensed commercial vehicles, and other illegal business vehicles throughout the entire county.
