Borgba had two yellow cards in the Coppa Italia last season and will be automatically banned for one match under the rules.
Although he has moved back to the Premier League, the FA has extended his suspension to the Premier League.
As a result, Bogba will be on the sidelines of the 14 August away game against Bournemouth and his return to Manchester United will be postponed until his home game against Southampton on 20 August.
