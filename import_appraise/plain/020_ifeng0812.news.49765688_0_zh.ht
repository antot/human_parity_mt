Although it has yet to be proven, many information sources indicate that Apple will hold its 2016 Fall event in September. iPhone 7 is really on its way.
Although Apple did not respond, news concerning the functions and configuration of the iPhone are being released gradually. Pictures of the “actual phone model” have even appeared on the Internet.
The new iPhone could be considered a “public phenomenon”. It’s popular, sleek, and could not be acquired even if you have the money to pay for it. If you want to buy an original product, you must opt for a proper sales channel such as Suning.
This heightened the people’s sense of disappointment for the new cellphone. “It became longer, but couldn’t project holographs! This iPhone release sucks.”
Like other iPhones, numerous anecdotes and secret information accompanied the iPhone 7 before its debut.
Elsewhere, many sources of information also claimed that the 3.5mm headphone jack will be removed from the new iPhone to be replaced by bluetooth connection and the charging interface. This will give Apple room for adding a second speaker.
Another piece of corroborative evidence is that as far back as 2014, Apple had already allowed headphone manufacturers to connect headphone products through the charging interface.
The answer to such news, whether true or false, will only be revealed by Apple at the 2016 Fall launch event.
This did not stop industry insiders from taking a positive view of the prospects of iPhone 7 however. Many believed that iPhone 7 could very well be the last time Apple would significantly upgrade the iPhone series.
However, data recently published by IDC, a market intelligence firm, showed the market share of iPhone has decreased slightly.
Goldman Sachs has rated Apple shares as something that can be “bought”. BMO analysts believe that iPhone7 will establish a historical record in sales performance.
Broadcom CEO Hock Tan also expressed that Apple is expected to achieve more than 20% growth in revenue. This figure can be completely attributed to the release of iPhone7.
7% of those interviewed said they intend to buy iPhone 7 compared to a mere 4% who planned to buy iPhone 6 two years ago.
From information available, 20% of users currently holding an iPhone6 or 6Plus have plans for purchasing iPhone7. This proportion is quite substantial.
Next, experts analyzed that most Apple fans like to replace their iPhone every other generation.
Statistics revealed that among iPhone users, approximately 26% of users have not changed their mobile phones in two years, i.e., the iPhones of about 120 million users have been used for two years.
Some media reported that Taiwan has been hit by several earthquakes during the iPhone7 production period. “Damages sustained by TSMC production facilities may have went beyond expectations, and that could have influenced initial supply for iPhone7.”
Supply and demand conflicts will influence normal users. It is time to select a proper channel and acquire an authentic iPhone7 early at a low price.
Insider disclosure revealed that the upper management of Suning and Apple has met frequently in recent times for the purpose of preparing enough resources.
Service operators have reached an agreement with Suning. It can be expected that with growing partnership between the two, users will be provided with lower prices and more dedicated services.
" The lowest price. The customers might' only RMB 7 a day to get a iPhone7".
Sufficient supply of goods and a variety of discounts, buyers of iPhone 7 will not be so stressed out, and Suning’s logistics department will all the more turn this happiness into a more intuitive experience.
Perhaps you will receive a phone call at midnight. “Hello, this is Suning.com. Your iPhone 7 has arrived.”
