Original title: A poultry farm with 2,000 chickens in Jiangsu seized by the legal court - farm owner given a penalty for unlicensed sales
Once the verdict enters into force, since Li is not obliged to verify the actions that he must perform according to law, Wang asked the court of Shuyang County to enforce the implementation of said actions.
In October 16, 2014, the court of Shuyang gave a civil verdict, and ruled to seize the 2,000 egg-laying hens in Liâ€™s poultry farm. The chickens may not be transferred or sold without permission.
Upon receiving the verdict from the court, Li privately sold, without permission from the court of Shuyang, a number of egg hens from the poultry farm in question that formed part of the seized property.
During an inspection carried out by the Shuyang County Public Security Bureau on March 8, 2015, there were only 142 egg-laying hens in the chicken farm.
