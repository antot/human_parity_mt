The New South Wales state government will spend 200 million Australian dollars (154 million U.S. dollars) on the biggest renovation of the famous Sydney Opera House since it was built, Xinhua reported Wednesday.
The NSW government said the renovation would not change the opera house's shell-like appearance.
The Sydney Opera House, one of Sydney's iconic buildings, was designed by Danish architect Jon Utzon and was completed in 1973, hosting about eight million visitors a year.
Rory Jeffs, general manager of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, believes the Sydney Opera House will use the revamp to make a "turnaround" and become "one of the best acoustics concert halls in the world."
