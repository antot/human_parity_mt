On some nights, the ionosphere is full of free electrons, which means that radio signals can go farther.
The U.S. Air Force is interested in the effect of replication, according to the August 11 report of the Popular Science Monthly website.
While the ionosphere, which has a stable mass of free electrons, can help people listen to the radio at the edge of a university radio station, that may not be the interest of the U.S. Air Force.
The electron-filled ionosphere means that the military uses a greater range of radios, and it may provide some protection from the Global Positioning System (GPS) signals from solar storms.
The ultimate goal may be to build a series of cube satellites based on demand, which can strengthen the ionosphere when needed.
But first, the team that signed the contract with the Air Force must demonstrate that the scientific principles will work.
