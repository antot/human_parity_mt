When mass SMS fraud reaches a certain number, even if the fraud was unsuccessful, one may be found guilty of committing fraud.
Proceedings by the Peopleâ€™s Court of Wolong District in Nanyang City of Henan Province found that the accused, Li Huiwang, used a fake base station device to send fraudulent messages at Tongbo County and Nanyang City areas from September 30 to October 4, 2015.
In the same year, at around 10 on October 5, the defendant checked into a room in a hotel at Wolong district, Nanyang City, and used a fake base station to commit mass SMS fraud. He was arrested by Public Security officers.
According to assessments, the fake base station sent a total of 62,228 message notifications on October 4, 2015, interrupting communications for 62,228 cellphone users for a period ranging from 8 seconds to 10 minutes.
After reviewing the case, the court believes that the defendant Li Huiwang used a fake base station to send a total of 62,228 fraudulent messages to an unspecified but large number of people, an act that has established the criminal act of fraud.
As the defense attorney said that the defendant did not attempt the crime or caused the crime to occur, and exhibited a positive attitude when pleading guilty, the attorney recommended adopting a lighter punishment.
Taking into consideration the criminal nature of the defendant, his attitude toward admission of guilt and other circumstances, he was sentenced to four years and six months in prison and fined 10,000 yuan for committing fraud.
