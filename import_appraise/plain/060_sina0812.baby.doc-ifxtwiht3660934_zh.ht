After a baby is born, parents must assume responsibility for this life. This responsibility does not merely concern the physical health of the child but also mental development, i.e. education.
Failing in children’s education is a loss in life and family that cannot be compensated by success in career-building.
When a life is born, the new parents must spend time and effort to take care and educate the child, and be responsible to it.
To become responsible, in addition to caring for the body, providing them with a healthy and spiritual education, the children are taught how to socialize properly, become responsible adults, and gain success.
Good family education means that parents must spend time with their children often and provide them with love, patient care, and teach them how to develop well-mannered speech and behavior, allowing children to achieve better learning and improvements to their mental skills.
Every saying and act of parents will influence the development of their child. The child will often mimic their parents, just like the traditional saying that goes: “A dragon gives birth to a dragon, a phoenix gives rise to a phoenix. A rat’s child will eventually learn to dig holes.” The child will take after its parents.
Parents must provide a good role model in front of their children, control their words and saying, and develop an excellent character of their own. All this can indirectly help build a positive personality in children and make them more successful.
