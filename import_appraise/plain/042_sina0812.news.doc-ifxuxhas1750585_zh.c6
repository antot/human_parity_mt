Uber's entry into the Taiwan market for four years has had a big impact on the region's traditional taxi industry.
Taiwan's United Daily News reported on August 12 that more than 100 taxis took a detour around Taiwan's "Executive Yuan" in protest, causing severe traffic paralysis in the surrounding area.
Zheng Lijia, chairman of the Taipei Drivers' Union, said Uber had been in Taiwan for four years and that the Taiwan authorities had only held a meeting at the end of this month and drivers were no longer able to wait.
Yet the government has failed to live up to its word, dragging its feet.
Law-abiding taxi drivers, who belong to the bottom labour force, have to compete with Uber, which is illegal but not restricted, and feel cheated by the authorities.
