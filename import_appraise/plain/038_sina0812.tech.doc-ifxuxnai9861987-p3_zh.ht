Since it was first revealed, iPhoneSE has initiated a massive hype and a sudden trend for small screen devices for the cellphone market.
Not too long ago, Nubia also released its flagship product for the Z11 series: Nubia Z11 mini.
The nubiaZ11min inherited its customary excellent photographic gene. Equipped with a single hand easy-to-hold 5-inch screen as well as a convenient and easy-to-use fingerprint identification setup at the back, its user experience is outstanding.
The nubia Z11 mini, a small screen camera phone that has just been released, is provided with another 200 RMB discount, reducing its price from 1,499 RMB to 1,299 RMB.
For the exterior design, nubiaZ11mini has a 5'' 1080P screen with the signature small red ring at the front bottom.
The middle axis is made of metal material. A symmetrical design is used for the bottom, and a Type-C data interface has been installed.
