Gilead receives legal fees in hepatitis C patent battle with Merck
According to the U.S. District Judge's decision, Gilead Scientific is entitled to legal fees incurred in the hepatitis C patent lawsuit against the pharmaceutical company Merck Group of America.
In June, after a U.S. judge found Merck guilty of wrongdoing, including perjury and other unethical behavior, Gilead was exempt from paying $200 million in damages for violations of two patents by Gilead's best-selling drugs, Sofibwe and Havoni.
In Thursday's lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Beth Lamberson Freeman said Gilliard did not have to bear the costs incurred by his defense.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, who dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of people with the disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, each claiming to be the owner of the laboratory work at Sofibwe, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
