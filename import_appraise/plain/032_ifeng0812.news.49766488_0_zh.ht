The 2016 Yangtse Evening Post Liqun Sunshine Scholarship Program was activated on May 26. After 2 months of registration, more than 800 needy students have applied for the scholarship.
During the school financial aid process, donations from the public have exceeded RMB1.2 million (five separate announcements have been made) which will help 240 poor students achieve their dream of studying in a university.
Donations are still ongoing. We encourage the general public to extend their hand in support so that more children from families in need could receive aid and social care.
To ensure that student aid is fair, open and transparent, we will publicly disclose basic information of students in batches in our newspaper from today onward. Information on the first to the 100th student is disclosed publicly today to be inspected and supervised by readers.
The Liqun Sunshine Scholarship Program is a famous charity brand in China. The Yangtse Evening Post Liqun Sunshine Scholarship Program was initiated in 2003 at Jiangsu and helped a total of 4,000 students from needy backgrounds.
The scope of this activityâ€™s subsidy is to enroll new students for the college entrance exam, and excludes tuition-free specialization. Candidates should have good moral character and academic results, and come from poor families.
