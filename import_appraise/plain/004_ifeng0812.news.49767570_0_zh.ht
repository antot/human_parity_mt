Tajikistan’s “Avesta” news agency, citing information from the Tajik central bank, claimed that Tajikistan’s inflation was 3.7% for the first seven months of this year.
The report pointed out that inflation in Tajikistan was 3.7% in the first seven months of this year. In particular, inflation in the month of July was 0.6%, while inflation for the most recent year was 6%.
The report said that the aim of the Tajik government is to maintain annual inflation rate within 7.5% in 2016. In 2015, the inflation rate of Tajikistan was 5.1%.
Reports further pointed out that for economic development and inflation issues faced by Tajikistan in 2016, the Tajik government and a number of major international financial institutions made different predictions in these areas.
Tajikistan’s Ministry of Economic Development and Trade forecast that the nation’s economic growth would reach 7% in 2016, while inflation would also be above this level in general.
On the other hand, the Asia Development Bank, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund respectively gave different predictions for economic development and inflation of Tajikistan in 2016.
As regards these two indicators, forecasts by the Asian Development Bank was 4.2% and 7%; the World Bank’s was 4.8% and 7.5%; and that of the International Monetary Fund at 3.4% and 8.2%.
From our understanding, although affected by a series of negative external factors that include poor global economy, depreciation of the Russian ruble, and reducing foreign remittance, the Tajik economy managed to achieve a 6% growth in 2015.
