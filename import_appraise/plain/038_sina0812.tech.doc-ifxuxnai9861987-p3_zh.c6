The mobile phone market has also seen a boom in small screens since the stunning debut of the iPhone SE.
Not long ago, Nubia also launched the first piece of its Z11 series: nubiaZ11mini.
The nubiaZ11mini continues its tradition of superior photography with a 5.0-inch screen that is easier to hold with one hand, and easy-to-use rear fingerprint recognition for a superior user experience.
Nubia's newly listed small screen photo phone, the Z11mini, reduced its price by $200, or $1,299, from $1,499.
In terms of appearance, the nubiaZ11mini features a 5-inch 1080P screen, with the classic "little red circle" design still underneath the front.
The middle frame is made of metal, and the bottom is symmetrically designed and equipped with a Type-C data interface.
