Jewish filmmakers criticise Berlin hotel for removing Israeli phone code as "requested" by Arab customers - Reuters News
A French filmmaker with Jewish roots revealed to the media that the Kempinski Hotel in Berlin did not list the Israeli phone code, and that the hotel staff said it was in accordance with the "requirements" of Arab customers, sparking a public outcry.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary The Holocaust, expressed his disappointment at the Kempinski Hotel and published an open letter in Frankfurt, Germany.
During his most recent stay, Lanzmann wanted to find Israel on the list of phone codes provided by the hotel.
But Israel is not among the countries where guests can call directly from their rooms.
Israel actually disappeared in Berlin, Germany's capital, in 2016?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, guests can call Israel through the Kempinski Hotel's call center.
In search of an explanation, the filmmaker asked the hotel's front desk.
In his letter, Mr Lanzman said he was "shocked" by the response he received at the front desk.
Hotel staff said it was a "deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski Hotel."
And the reason for doing so has made the filmmaker angry.
Langzman quoted the employee as saying: "Most of our guests are Arabs and they are demanding that the Israeli code be removed."
According to the South German Daily News, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Haddas Handelsmann, called the incident "an outrage."
We were surprised to learn about the incident.
This in itself is a great shame.
And what happened in Germany and the hotel chain was even more humiliating.
There is no need for any explanation.
"We hope that the hotel will come to the right conclusion," the official said.
The incident sparked a heated debate online and everyone thought it was a scandal.
Some see the Kempinski hotel as simply "kowtowing" to meet the demands of Arab customers.
Another post pointed to the hotel as "shameless" and pointed out that the main street on the famous Kudam Street is near a synagogue.
According to Der Spiegel, the hotel was quick to clarify all the allegations, claiming that everything was "negligent" and offering "apologies" to Lanzmann.
The Nande Daily News quoted Kempinski's representative as saying: "There has never been a direct order to remove Israel from the speed dial list."
The newspaper also said the Israeli code had been added to the list.
