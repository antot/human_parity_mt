The organizers hope that through the cultural Relics exhibition, the local people will know more about the history of Chinese culture, so as to enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples.
The "Ming Dynasty Cultural Relics exhibition" in Barcelona is part of the European Tour, which will last until the beginning of October.
